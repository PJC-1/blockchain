**Genesis block**

>
> The first block in a *blockchain* is known as a **genesis block**. Modern versions of Bitcoin number it as *block 0*, thought very early version counted it as *block 1*.
>
> The *genesis block* is almost always hardcoded into the software of the applications that utilize its block chain.
> It is a special case in that it does not reference a previous block, and for *Bitcoin* and almost all of its derivatives, it produces an unspendable subsidy.
